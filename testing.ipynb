playing you though I think he might be he he he he like he blinked to himself when he was talking about what was on the note or whatever but like that that could just be a sprinkler lie take the box Harry can't get robbed twice can he it's personal between me and you take the box I think he's trolling you I think he knew something that you didn't want and you're going to go I don't want any more I don't want that  box I know what box I want I don't want that box take the box are you 100% there's nothing you leaving out no there's what nothing you're leaving out in there no it's quite a basic box yeah just why would I take a load of hor but he's lying why would be happy about it you're not looking in the eyes bro who said he was happy is a second time it's practice oh I don't like that I didn't like that like that but then again you could be playing me I'll take the box but I don't want the Box he's in rub twice this is perfect if it's good this is the worst I get every box I get I get jacked fastest Flipper the finale the players must flip a bottle and every time they land they get to move the bottle towards their opponent first one off the end wins three there's no point two one ble what if the what's going on oh hell oh they're the level this guy stanked move it back oh come on we could be here a while we could be here a while oh no no pressure no oh oh bottled it stop looking oh he's got another why would it land two more stop looking you got to land the Bott fli Under Pressure oh one more oh hurry up Josh you're moving slow  oh no quick no one more no one more think of the comeback is hanging on yit I've just realized Harry's going to seen three boxes three boxes just to pre-warn you yeah you pick one yeah and then you have to tell him what's in it yeah again he can steal it again again so whether you want to pick the one you don't oh this a stressful day man you R three times are you Harry three times robbery right green or red GRE the one you want the very B stop or go I want to see what's in the Big Green Box I want to see what's in the big green box that's been my box the is an information is mad all right my third bunny Box O Okay dead box

you okay cool you hello you've taken the box that I always wanted the whole time yes so I'm in a bit of a predicament here what's inside that box she looks a bit for used a bit unsure well they didn't let me go inside it which is what worries me so what is in the box if you care to know is a sand pit and then a treasure chest in the middle of the sand that sounds fun that's it though there's nothing else in the Box I think that is in there you know I take that box that box Josh you wanted that box all day yeah I wanted that box the whole time but you know this information so would you then fabricate the story I think that's enticing that I'd want to get [Music] into why is it treasure chest what's what about his treasure it looks like one of them classic like wooden pirate on
